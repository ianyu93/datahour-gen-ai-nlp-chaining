    "When describing data model, this is not to be confused with machine learning models. A data model is a description of how data should be structured and related to each other. A machine learning model is a mathematical model that learns to make predictions from data.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) is the most popular library for data validation and settings management based on Python type hints. [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor) is a library that extends Pydantic to support OpenAI's function calling. [Function calling](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates) is basically passing a JSON schema as part of the prompt to the model, attempting to force the model to generate a specific JSON output. Even if you're not using OpenAI as your model, you can still attempt to pass a JSON schema to your model and see if it generates the output you want. And, you should still use Pydantic or its alternatives to validate the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how some of the field descriptions are written in a way that is similar to how you would write a prompt. This is because function calling will be passing these description to the model as part of the prompt and infer what the output should be. If you are writing an API endpoint exposed by your model, such description is not as clean and should be written in a way that is more suitable for API documentation."
